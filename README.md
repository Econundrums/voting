# Don't Vote. Play the Lottery Instead.

Inspired by this [old Slate article](https://slate.com/culture/2004/09/don-t-vote-play-the-lottery-instead.html), as well as constant harrassment from the "eVeRy vOtE cOuNtS!!!" zealots, this RShiny app allows users to see just how little their individual vote matters in the Presidential General Election.

### Requirements

You need to have R installed, which you can do [here](https://www.r-project.org/), along with the following packages.

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinythemes", "ggplot2", "plotly", "usmap", "dplyr", "readxl"))
```
If the above code snippet doesn't work, try installing each of the above packages individually (e.g. `install.packages('shiny')`).

For ease of use, especially if you're a beginner, I <b>strongly</b> recommend you also download [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) after you download R, then open and launch the app from there.
